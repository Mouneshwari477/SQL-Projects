### 📊 Project Overview

Using an automotive dataset containing information such as car models, mileage, fuel type, transmission, ownership, selling price, year, and more, this project answers industry-focused analytical questions like:

Which car models have the highest average mileage?

What are the pricing trends across fuel types and ownership categories?

Which vehicles experience the highest depreciation over time?

Which transmission type shows the highest cumulative mileage?

What models fall within 10% of the average selling price?

Are there year-over-year price drops for specific models?
