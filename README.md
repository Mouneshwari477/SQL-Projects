# SQL-Projects

## 🚗 1.Automotive Industry Insights

This project explores key trends and patterns in the automotive industry using SQL.
The goal is to analyze vehicle sales, pricing behavior, mileage efficiency, ownership patterns, and performance over time using real-world automotive data.

The project demonstrates strong SQL skills including:

Joins

Window functions

Subqueries

Aggregations

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Ranking & analytics functions

### 📊 Project Overview

Using an automotive dataset containing information such as car models, mileage, fuel type, transmission, ownership, selling price, year, and more, this project answers industry-focused analytical questions like:

Which car models have the highest average mileage?

What are the pricing trends across fuel types and ownership categories?

Which vehicles experience the highest depreciation over time?

Which transmission type shows the highest cumulative mileage?

What models fall within 10% of the average selling price?

Are there year-over-year price drops for specific models?

### 🔍 Key SQL Concepts Applied

Window Functions:
LAG(), SUM() OVER, RANK(), moving averages

Subqueries & Correlated Subqueries

Aggregation & Grouping:
AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), COUNT()

Filtering & Pattern Extraction

CTEs (WITH statements)

Data exploration & performance trends

### 📈 Sample Insights Obtained

Identified top-performing models based on mileage and sales

Calculated year-wise cumulative selling price for each model

Detected car models with significant price fluctuations

Analyzed selling price differences across fuel types and transmission types

Found vehicles priced within 10% of market average

## 🏥 2.Healthcare Data Analysis

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a healthcare dataset using SQL.
It explores patient demographics, hospitalization trends, billing patterns, medical conditions, insurance coverage, hospital performance, and more.
The queries uncover insights that can support healthcare operations, patient management, and resource planning.

### 📌 Project Overview

Using a structured healthcare dataset, this project answers critical analytical questions such as:

What is the average age of hospitalized patients?

Which medical conditions have the highest number of patients?

What are the most prescribed medications by condition?

Which insurance providers and hospitals are most preferred?

What is the average billing amount for each condition?

How many days do patients typically spend in a hospital?

Which patients are universal blood donors or recipients?

How can we identify high-risk vs low-risk patients based on test results?

All queries are written in SQL with a focus on analytics, aggregation, ranking, window functions, and real-world healthcare insights.

### 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

This project demonstrates strong SQL skills including:

Aggregations: COUNT(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM()

Grouping & Ordering: Demographic and medical-condition analysis

Window Functions: DENSE_RANK(), RANK(), OVER()

Date Functions: DATEDIFF(), calculating hospitalization days

Subqueries

Stored Procedures

Filtering & pattern extraction

CASE statements for risk classification

### 🔍 Key Insights Generated
